This module allows you to use SMS as second factor for user authentication.

While SMS is not the most secure way of delivering a secret, it's still safer
than no multi factor authentication at all.

**Table of contents**

Configuration
=============

#. Go to Settings/Technical/SMS providers and configure a provider.
   While you can configure multiple ones, the addon will always pick the
   topmost active provider for authorization.
#. On a user, enable the `Use SMS verification` checkbox

The addon understands the following configuration parameters:

   auth_sms.code_chars
      The characters used to generate a code. Default is generated from
      Python's string.ascii_letters + string.digits.

      You can repeat characters here to make some more or less probable to be
      used.

   auth_sms.code_length
      The length of a code to be sent to the user via SMS. Default is 8.

   auth_sms.rate_limit_limit, auth_sms.rate_limit_hours
      The amount of sms to send for one user within a certain amount of time.
      Default is to send at most 10 SMS within 24 hours.

Usage
=====

After a user has filled in the correct credentials, she will be taken to a second form where she's asked for the code that has been sent via SMS.

Known issues / Roadmap
======================

* add a config wizard to configure parameters
* add a button to send another code
* make SMS codes time out (currently they live as long as the session they were
  generated for)
* make being able to turn on 2FA depend on some security group
* create some auth_mfa_code module and move a lot of code there to have a
  common base for all MFA modules that generate some extra code to fill in

JWT bearer token authentication.

Installation
============

This module requires the ``pyjwt`` library to be installed.

Usage
=====

This module lets developpers add a new ``jwt`` authentication method on Odoo
controller routes.

To use it, you must:

* Create an ``auth.jwt.validator`` record to configure how the JWT token will
  be validated.
* Add an ``auth="jwt_{validator-name}"`` or ``auth="public_or_jwt_{validator-name}"``
  attribute to the routes you want to protect where ``{validator-name}`` corresponds to
  the name attribute of the JWT validator record.

The ``auth_jwt_demo`` module provides examples.

The JWT validator can be configured with the following properties:

* ``name``: the validator name, to match the ``auth="jwt_{validator-name}"``
  route property.
* ``audience``: a comma-separated list of allowed audiences, used to validate
  the ``aud`` claim.
* ``issuer``: used to validate the ``iss`` claim.
* Signature type (secret or public key), algorithm, secret and JWK URI
  are used to validate the token signature.

In addition, the ``exp`` claim is validated to reject expired tokens.

If the ``Authorization`` HTTP header is missing, malformed, or contains
an invalid token, the request is rejected with a 401 (Unauthorized) code,
unless the cookie mode is enabled (see below).

If the token is valid, the request executes with the configured user id. By
default the user id selection strategy is ``static`` (i.e. the same for all
requests) and the selected user is configured on the JWT validator. Additional
strategies can be provided by overriding the ``_get_uid()`` method and
extending the ``user_id_strategy`` selection field.

The selected user is *not* stored in the session. It is only available in
``request.uid`` (and thus it is the one used in ``request.env``). To avoid any
confusion and mismatches between the bearer token and the session, this module
rejects requests made with an authenticated user session.

Additionally, if a ``partner_id_strategy`` is configured, a partner is searched
and if found, its id is stored in the ``request.jwt_partner_id`` attribute. If
``partner_id_required`` is set, a 401 (Unauthorized) is returned if no partner
was found. Otherwise ``request.jwt_partner_id`` is left falsy. Additional
strategies can be provided by overriding the ``_get_partner_id()`` method
and extending the ``partner_id_strategy`` selection field.

The decoded JWT payload is stored in ``request.jwt_payload``.

The ``public_auth_jwt`` method delegates authentication to the standard Odoo ``public``
method when the Authorization header is not set. If it is set, the regular JWT
authentication is performed as described above. This method is useful for public
endpoints that need to work for anonymous users, but can be enhanced when an
authenticated user is know. A typical use case is a "add to cart" endpoint that can work
for anonymous users, but can be enhanced by binding the cart to a known customer when
the authenticated user is known.

You can enable a cookie mode on JWT validators. In this case, the JWT payload obtained
from the ``Authorization`` header is returned as a Http-Only cookie. This mode is
sometimes simpler for front-end applications which do not then need to store and protect
the JWT token across requests and can simply rely on the cookie management mechanisms of
browsers. When both the ``Authorization`` header and a cookie are provided, the cookie
is ignored in order to let clients authenticate with a different user by providing a new
JWT token.

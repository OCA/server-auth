This module builds on auth_dynamic_groups to include all users that have an
active contract including certain products in that group.

Configuration
=============

Use `Based on contracts for products` on a group, if you want to add users
to a group based on wether their partners have an active contract for
a product linked to this group.

On the tab page `Dynamic` you will be able to select the products that qualify
for membership of the group, if the partner has an active contractline for
that product.

Usage
=====

We want to have a group called `Our Newsletter` that should contain all
users that have an active contract, including lines for the products
`Daily update` and `Our digital magazine`. So we create the dynamic group
and specify that it is based on contracts. Then we update the products to
refer to the newly created group.

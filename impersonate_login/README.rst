This module allows one user (for example, a member of the support team)
to log in as another user. The impersonation session can be exited by
clicking on the button "Back to Original User".

To ensure that any abuse of this feature will not go unnoticed, the
following measures are in place:

-  In the chatter, it is displayed who is the user that is logged as
   another user.
-  Mails and messages are sent from the original user.
-  Impersonated logins are logged and can be consulted through the
   Settings -> Technical menu.
-  

There is an alternative module to allow logins as another user
(auth_admin_passkey), but it does not support these security mechanisms.

Configuration
=============

The impersonating user must belong to group "Impersonate Users".

Usage
=====

1. In the menu that is displayed when clicking on the user avatar on the
   top right corner, or in the res.users list, click "Switch Login" to
   impersonate another user.
2. On the top-right corner, the button "Back to Original User" is
   displayed in case the current user is being impersonated.

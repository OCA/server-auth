This module allows users to login through an OpenID Connect provider using the
authorization code flow or implicit flow.

Note the implicit flow is not recommended because it exposes access tokens to
the browser and in http logs.

Installation
============

This module depends on the `python-jose <https://pypi.org/project/python-jose/>`__
library, not to be confused with ``jose`` which is also available on PyPI.

Configuration
=============

Setup for Microsoft Azure
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Example configuration with OpenID Connect authorization code flow.

# configure a new web application in Azure with OpenID and code flow (see
  the `provider documentation
  <https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/powerapps/maker/portals/configure/configure-openid-provider)>`_)
# in this application the redirect url must be be "<url of your
  server>/auth_oauth/signin" and of course this URL should be reachable from
  Azure
# create a new authentication provider in Odoo with the following
  parameters (see the `portal documentation
  <https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/powerapps/maker/portals/configure/configure-openid-settings>`_
  for more information):

.. image:: https://raw.githubusercontent.com/OCA/server-auth/16.0/auth_oidc/..static/description/oauth-microsoft_azure-optional_claims.png

Single tenant provider limits the access to user of your tenant,
while Multitenants allow access for all AzureAD users, so user of foreign companies can use their AzureAD login
without an guest account.

* Provider Name: Azure AD Single Tenant
* Client ID: Application (client) id
* Client Secret: Client secret
* Allowed: yes

or

* Provider Name: Azure AD Multitenant
* Client ID: Application (client) id
* Client Secret: Client secret
* Allowed: yes
* replace {tenant_id} in urls with your Azure tenant id

Setup for Keycloak
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Example configuration with OpenID Connect authorization code flow.

In Keycloak:

# configure a new Client
# make sure Authorization Code Flow is Enabled.
# configure the client Access Type as "confidential" and take note of the client secret in the Credentials tab
# configure the redirect url to be "<url of your server>/auth_oauth/signin"

In Odoo, create a new Oauth Provider with the following parameters:

* Provider name: Keycloak (or any name you like that identify your keycloak
  provider)
* Auth Flow: OpenID Connect (authorization code flow)
* Client ID: the same Client ID you entered when configuring the client in Keycloak
* Client Secret: found in keycloak on the client Credentials tab
* Allowed: yes
* Body: the link text to appear on the login page, such as Login with Keycloak
* Scope: openid email
* Authentication URL: The "authorization_endpoint" URL found in the
  OpenID Endpoint Configuration of your Keycloak realm
* Token URL: The "token_endpoint" URL found in the
  OpenID Endpoint Configuration of your Keycloak realm
* JWKS URL: The "jwks_uri" URL found in the
  OpenID Endpoint Configuration of your Keycloak realm

Usage
=====

On the login page, click on the authentication provider you configured.

Known issues / Roadmap
======================

* When going to the login screen, check for a existing token and do a direct login without the clicking on the SSO link
* When doing a logout an extra option to also logout at the SSO provider.

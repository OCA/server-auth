Setup for Microsoft Azure
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Example configuration with OpenID Connect implicit flow.
This configuration is not recommended because it exposes the access token
to the client, and in logs.

# configure a new web application in Azure with OpenID and implicit flow (see
  the `provider documentation
  <https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/powerapps/maker/portals/configure/configure-openid-provider)>`_)
# in this application the redirect url must be be "<url of your
  server>/auth_oauth/signin" and of course this URL should be reachable from
  Azure
# create a new authentication provider in Odoo with the following
  parameters (see the `portal documentation
  <https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/powerapps/maker/portals/configure/configure-openid-settings>`_
  for more information):

* Provider Name: Azure
* Auth Flow: OpenID Connect
* Client ID: use the value of the OAuth2 autorization endoing (v2) from the Azure Endpoints list
* Body: Azure SSO
* Authentication URL: use the value of "OAuth2 autorization endpoint (v2)" from the Azure endpoints list
* Scope: openid email
* Validation URL: use the value of "OAuth2 token endpoint (v2)" from the Azure endpoints list
* Allowed: yes


Setup for Keycloak
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Example configuration with OpenID Connect authorization code flow.

In Keycloak:

# configure a new Client
# make sure Authorization Code Flow is Enabled.
# configure the client Access Type as "confidential" and take note of the client secret in the Credentials tab
# configure the redirect url to be "<url of your server>/auth_oauth/signin"

In Odoo, create a new Oauth Provider with the following parameters:

* Provider name: Keycloak (or any name you like that identify your keycloak
  provider)
* Auth Flow: OpenID Connect (authorization code flow)
* Client ID: the same Client ID you entered when configuring the client in Keycloak
* Client Secret: found in keycloak on the client Credentials tab
* Allowed: yes
* Body: the link text to appear on the login page, such as Login with Keycloak
* Scope: openid email
* Authentication URL: The "authorization_endpoint" URL found in the
  OpenID Endpoint Configuration of your Keycloak realm
* Token URL: The "token_endpoint" URL found in the
  OpenID Endpoint Configuration of your Keycloak realm
* JWKS URL: The "jwks_uri" URL found in the
  OpenID Endpoint Configuration of your Keycloak realm

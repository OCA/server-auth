This module add the possibility to login with OAuth Resource Owner Password Credentials Grant

https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc6749#section-4.3

In most scenarios, more secure alternatives are available and recommended. This flow requires a very high degree of trust in the application, and carries risks that are not present in other flows. You should only use this flow when other more secure flows aren't viable.

This module is useful for the Odoo mobile application, which only supports user/password authentication.

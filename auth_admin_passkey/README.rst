  with any login. If not set, the feature is disabled.

* ``auth_admin_passkey_send_to_user`` (default True), if enabled, an email
  will be send to the user, if his account has been used by the
  System Administrator.

* ``auth_admin_passkey_sysadmin_email``. If set, an email will be sent to this
  mail.

* ``auth_admin_passkey_sysadmin_lang``. the language (exemple en_US), used for
  the mail sent to the System Administrator. If not set, the language of the
  SUPERUSER_ID user will be used.

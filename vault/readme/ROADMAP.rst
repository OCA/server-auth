* Field and file history for restoration

* Send secrets directly to an inbox within Odoo

* Import improvement

 * Support challenge-response/FIDO2

* When changing an entry from one vault to another existing vault, the values added on
  this entry cannot be accessed, so the field vault is going to be readonly when it
  is defined.

  If you want to move entries between vaults you can use the export -> import option.

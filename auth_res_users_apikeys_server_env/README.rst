Configure API keys (`res.users.apikeys`) per environment.

This can be very useful when other applications communicate with odoo
over jsonrpc to avoid mixing your keys between various
environments ie: when restoring Odoo production databases to staging/tests/dev environments.

This module let change the scope of your API keys in user form view. This module expect scope
set to `rpc_<env>` where `<env>` is the `running_env` used by `server_environment` module.

Configuration
=============


* got to the user preference form
* add new keys for each env on production databases
* set scope of each key regarding target environment with template: `rpc_<env>`
  where `<env>` is the `running_env` used by `server_environment` module.

only api key matching this env would works.

.. note::

    If you keep scope as empty string you would get default behavior and match any env
.. warning::

    Unfortunately as key are already encrypted and key field not expose to the ORM
    on base module we can't configure key in config files as it would be with
    server_environment and server_environment_data_encryption

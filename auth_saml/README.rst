Let users log into Odoo via an SAML2 identity provider.

This module allows to deport the management of users and passwords in an
external authentication system to provide SSO functionality (Single Sign On)
between Odoo and other applications of your ecosystem.

**Benefits**:

* Reducing the time spent typing different passwords for different accounts.

* Reducing the time spent in IT support for password oversights.

* Centralizing authentication systems.

* Securing all input levels / exit / access to multiple systems without
  prompting users.

* The centralization of access control information for compliance testing to
  different standards.

Installation
============

This addon requires the python module ``pysaml2``.

``pysaml2`` requires the binary ``xmlsec1`` (on Debian or Ubuntu you can install it with ``apt-get install xmlsec1``)

Configuration
=============

To use this module, you need an IDP server, properly set up.

#. Configure the module according to your IdP’s instructions
   (Settings > Users & Companies > SAML Providers).
#. Pre-create your users and set the SAML information against the user.

By default, the module let users have both a password and SAML ids.
To increase security, disable passwords by using the option in Settings.
Note that the admin account can still have a password, even if the option is activated.
Setting the option immediately remove all password from users with a configured SAML ids.

If all the users have a SAML id in a single provider, you can set automatic redirection
in the provider settings. The autoredirection will only be done on the active provider
with the highest priority. It is still possible to access the login without redirection
by using the query parameter ``disable_autoredirect``, as in
``https://example.com/web/login?disable_autoredirect=`` The login is also displayed if
there is an error with SAML login, in order to display any error message.

Usage
=====

Users can login with the configured SAML IdP with buttons added in the login screen.

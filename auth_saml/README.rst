Let users log into Odoo via an SAML2 provider.

This module allows to deport the management of users and passwords in an
external authentication system to provide SSO functionality (Single Sign On)
between Odoo and other applications of your ecosystem.

**Benefits**:

* Reducing the time spent typing different passwords for different accounts.

* Reducing the time spent in IT support for password oversights.

* Centralizing authentication systems.

* Securing all input levels / exit / access to multiple systems without
  prompting users.

* The centralization of access control information for compliance testing to
  different standards.

Installation
============

This addon requires `lasso`_.

.. _lasso: http://lasso.entrouvert.org

Configuration
=============

To use this module, you need an IDP server, properly set up. Go through the
"Getting started" section for more information.

Getting started with Authentic2
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

This is quick howto to help setup a service provider that will be able
to use the IDP from Authentic2

We will mostly cover how to setup your rsa keys and certificates


Creating the certs
------------------

Use easy-rsa from the easy-rsa package (or from the openvpn project)

Example script below with comment saying what you should do between each
command:

.. code-block:: bash

    #clean your vars

    source ./vars

    ./build-dh
    ./pkitool --initca

    #change your vars to math a new client cert

    source ./vars

    ./pkitool myclient


Congratulations, you now have a client certificate signed by a shiny new
CA under you own private control.

Configuring authentic
---------------------

We will not describe how to compile requirements nor start an authentic server.

Just log into your authentic admin panel::

  https://myauthenticserver/admin


and create a new "liberty provider".

You'll need to create a metadata xml file from a template (TODO)

You'll need to make sure it is activated and that the default protocol rules
are applied (ie: the requests are signed and signatures are verified)

Configuring Odoo
----------------

#. Go to *Settings > Activate the developer mode*.
#. **Configure your auth provider** going to *Settings > Users & Companies >
   SAML Providers > Create*. Your provider should provide you all that info.
#. Go to *Settings > Users & Companies > Users* and edit each user that will
   authenticate through SAML.
#. Go to the *SAML* tab and fill both fields.
#. Go to *Settings > General settings* and uncheck *Allow SAML users to posess
   an Odoo password* if you want your SAML users to authenticate only
   through SAML.

Usage
=====

#. Configure it (see corresponding section in README)
#. Just login with your SAML-provided password.

Known issues / Roadmap
======================

* Checks to ensure no Odoo user with SAML also has an Odoo password.
* Setting to disable that rule.

Changelog
=========

2.0
~~~

* SAML tokens are not stored in res_users anymore to avoid locks on that table

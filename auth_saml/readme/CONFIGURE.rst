To use this module, you need an IDP server, properly set up.

#. Configure the module according to your IdPâ€™s instructions
   (Settings > Users & Companies > SAML Providers).
#. Pre-create your users and set the SAML information against the user.

By default, the module let users have both a password and SAML ids.
To increase security, disable passwords by using the option in Settings.
Note that the admin account can still have a password, even if the option is activated.
Setting the option immediately remove all password from users with a configured SAML ids.

If all the users have a SAML id in a single provider, you can set automatic redirection
in the provider settings. The autoredirection will only be done on the active provider
with the highest priority. It is still possible to access the login without redirection
by using the query parameter ``disable_autoredirect``, as in
``https://example.com/web/login?disable_autoredirect=`` The login is also displayed if
there is an error with SAML login, in order to display any error message.

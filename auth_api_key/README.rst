Authenticate http requests from an API key.

API keys are codes passed in (in the http header API-KEY)
by programs calling an API in order to identify -in this case- the calling program's user.

Take care while using this kind of mechanism since information into http headers are visible in clear.
Thus, use it only to authenticate requests from known sources.

For unknown sources, it is a good practice to filter out this header at proxy level.

**Table of contents**

.. contents::
   :local:

Configuration
=============

The api key menu is available into Settings > Technical in debug mode.
By default, when you create an API key, the key is saved into the database.

If you want to manage them via serve environment settings use `auth_api_key_server_env`.

Usage
=====

To apply this authentication system to your http request you must set 'api_key'
as value for the 'auth' parameter of your route definition into your controller.

.. code-block:: python

    class MyController(Controller):

        @route('/my_service', auth='api_key', ...)
        def my_service(self, *args, **kwargs):
            pass

Restrict the ability to authenticate via regular password authentication, to a
whitelist of IP addresses.

This module allows you to conditionally disable password authentication, which
can be useful in combination with other authentication modules as an
alternative.

Also, the conventional email & password fields on the login screen are hidden by
default. In order to use them, you can show them again by adding `?debug=1` in
the url.

Usage
=====

When this module is installed, you can enable the regular password login form by
adding `?debug=1` to your browser's url.

Configuring the IP whitelist is done in the `odoo.conf` configuration file, with
the `auth_pass_ip_whitelist` parameter like so:
```
auth_pass_ip_whitelist = ["127.0.0.1", "192.168.1.7"]
```
If this parameter is not set, it defaults to `["127.0.0.1"]`.

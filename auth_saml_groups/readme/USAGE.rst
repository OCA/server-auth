To use this module, you need to configure the mapping of groups by:

#. Defining a matching parameter depending on your SAML idp.
#. Choosing between operators 'contains' and 'equals' depending on your condition.
#. Assigning an odoo group to the matched SAML group.  
#. There is the option to allow only SAML groups; if this option is checked,
   only the groups matched with your defined mappings will be assigned to odoo users on
   each login.

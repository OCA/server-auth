This module adds support for MFA using TOTP (time-based, one-time passwords).
It allows users to enable/disable MFA and manage authentication apps/devices
via the "Change My Preferences" view and an associated wizard.

After logging in normally, users with MFA enabled are taken to a second screen
where they have to enter a password generated by one of their authentication
apps and are presented with the option to remember the current device. This
creates a secure, HTTP-only cookie that allows subsequent logins to bypass the
MFA step.

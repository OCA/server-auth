Configure api keys via server env.

This can be very useful to avoid mixing your keys between your various
environments when restoring databases. All you have to do is to add a new
section to your configuration file according to the following convention:

.. code-block:: ini

    [api_key_<Record Name>]
    key=my_api_key

.. IMPORTANT::
   This is an alpha version, the data model and design can change at any time without warning.
   Only for development or testing purpose, do not use in production.
